# Introduction to tidyllm
tidyllm is an R package designed to provide a unified interface for interacting with various large language model APIs. This vignette will guide you through the basic setup and usage of tidyllm.

## Installation

To install **tidyllm** from CRAN , use:

```{r, eval= FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("tidyllm")
```

Or install a current development version directly from GitHub using devtools:

```{r, eval= FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Install devtools if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

# Install TidyLLM from GitHub
devtools::install_github("edubruell/tidyllm")
```

### Setting up API Keys or ollama 

Before using tidyllm, you need to set up API keys for the services you plan to use. Here's how to set them up for different providers:

1. For Claude models you can get an API key in the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys):
```{r, eval= FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Sys.setenv(ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "YOUR-ANTHROPIC-API-KEY")
```

2. For ChatGPT you can obtain an API key by signing up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and set it with:
```{r, eval= FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY")
```
3. For Mistral you can set the API key on the [Mistral console page](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/) and set it by
``` r
Sys.setenv(MISTRAL_API_KEY = "MISTRAL-API-KEY-GOES-HERE")
```
4. For groq (not be confused with [grok](https://x.ai/)) you can setup you API keys in the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/playground):
```{r, eval= FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Sys.setenv(GROQ_API_KEY = "YOUR-GROQ-API-KEY")
```

Alternatively, you can set these keys in your `.Renviron` file for persistent storage. For this, execute `usethis::edit_r_environ()`, and add a
line with with an API key in this file, for example:

```{r, eval= FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR-ANTHROPIC-API-KEY"
```


If you want to work with local large lange models via `ollama` you need to install it from [the official project website](https://ollama.com/). Ollama sets up a local large language model server that you can use to run open-source models on your own devices. 

### Basic Usage

Let's start with a simple example using tidyllm to interact with different language models:

```{r convo1,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyllm)

# Start a conversation with Claude
conversation <- llm_message("What is the capital of France?") |>
  claude()

#Standard way that llm_messages are printed
conversation
```
```{r convo1_out,  eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyllm)

#Easier than mocking. httptest2 caused a few issues with my vignette
conversation <- llm_message("What is the capital of France?") |>
  llm_message("The capital of France is Paris.",.role="assistant")

conversation
```
```{r convo2,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Continue the conversation with ChatGPT
conversation <- conversation |>
  llm_message("What's a famous landmark in this city?") |>
  openai()

last_reply(conversation)
```
```{r convo2_out,  eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
c("A famous landmark in Paris is the Eiffel Tower.")
```


### Sending Images to Models

tidyllm also supports sending images to multimodal models. Let's send this picture here:
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("picture.jpeg")
```

Here we let ChatGPT guess where the picture was made:
```{r images,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Describe an image using a llava model on ollama
image_description <- llm_message("Describe this picture? Can you guess where it was made?",
                                 .imagefile = "picture.jpeg") |>
  openai(.model = "gpt-4o")

# Get the last reply
last_reply(image_description)
```
```{r images_out,  eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
c("The picture shows a beautiful landscape with a lake, mountains, and a town nestled below. The sun is shining brightly, casting a serene glow over the water. The area appears lush and green, with agricultural fields visible. \n\nThis type of scenery is reminiscent of northern Italy, particularly around Lake Garda, which features similar large mountains, picturesque water, and charming towns.")
```

### Adding PDFs to messages

The `llm_message()` function also supports extracting text from PDFs and including it in the message. This allows you to easily provide context from a PDF document when interacting with an AI assistant.

To use this feature, you need to have the `pdftools` package installed. If it is not already installed, you can install it with:

```{r,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("pdftools")
```

To include text from a PDF in your prompt, simply pass the file path to the `.pdf` argument of the `chat` function:

```{r pdf,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
llm_message("Please summarize the key points from the provided PDF document.", 
     .pdf = "die_verwandlung.pdf") |>
     openai(.model = "gpt-4o-mini")
```
```{r pdf_out,  eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
  llm_message("Please summarize the key points from the provided PDF document.", 
              .pdf="die_verwandlung.pdf") |>
    llm_message("Here are the key points from the provided PDF document 'Die Verwandlung' by Franz Kafka:

1. The story centers around Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning to find that he has been transformed into a giant insect-like creature.

2. Gregor's transformation causes distress and disruption for his family. They struggle to come to terms with the situation and how to deal with Gregor in his new state.

3. Gregor's family, especially his sister Grete, initially tries to care for him, but eventually decides they need to get rid of him. They lock him in his room and discuss finding a way to remove him.

4. Gregor becomes increasingly isolated and neglected by his family. He becomes weaker and less mobile due to his injuries and lack of proper care.

5. Eventually, Gregor dies, and his family is relieved. They then begin to make plans to move to a smaller, more affordable apartment and start looking for new jobs and opportunities.",.role="assistant")
```
The package will automatically extract the text from the PDF  and include it in the prompt sent to the an API. The text will be wrapped in `<pdf>` tags to clearly indicate the content from the PDF:

```
Please summarize the key points from the provided PDF document.

<pdf filename="example_document.pdf">
Extracted text from the PDF file...
</pdf>
```
### Sending R Outputs to Language Models

You can automatically include R code outputs in your prompts. 
`llm_message()` has an optional argument `.f` in which you can specify a (anonymous) function, which 
will be run and which console output will be captured and appended to the message when you run it.

In addition you can use `.caputre_plot` to send the last plot pane to a model. 

```{r routputs_base,  eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Create a plot for the mtcars example data
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = 'y ~ x') +
  labs(x="Weight",y="Miles per gallon")
```

Now we can send the plot and data summary to a language model:
```{r routputs_base_out,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
llm_message("Analyze this plot and data summary:", 
                  .capture_plot = TRUE, #Send the plot pane to a model
                  .f = ~{summary(mtcars)}) |> #Run summary(data) and send the output
  claude()
```
```{r routputs_base_rq,  eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Create a plot for the mtcars example data

llm_message("Analyze this plot and data summary:", 
                  .imagefile = "file1568f6c1b4565.png", #Send the plot pane to a model
                  .f = ~{summary(mtcars)}) |> #Run summary(data) and send the output
  llm_message("Based on the plot and data summary provided, here's an analysis:\n\n1. Relationship between Weight and MPG:\n   The scatter plot shows a clear negative correlation between weight (wt) and miles per gallon (mpg). As the weight of the car increases, the fuel efficiency (mpg) decreases.\n\n2. Linear Trend:\n   The blue line in the plot represents a linear regression fit. The downward slope confirms the negative relationship between weight and mpg.\n\n3. Data Distribution:\n   - The weight of cars in the dataset ranges from 1.513 to 5.424 (likely in thousands of pounds).\n   - The mpg values range from 10.40 to 33.90.\n\n4. Variability:\n   There's some scatter around the regression line, indicating that while weight is a strong predictor of mpg, other factors also influence fuel efficiency.\n\n5. Other Variables:\n   While not shown in the plot, the summary statistics provide information on other variables:\n   - Cylinder count (cyl) ranges from 4 to 8, with a median of 6.\n   - Horsepower (hp) ranges from 52 to 335, with a mean of 146.7.\n   - Transmission type (am) is binary (0 or 1), likely indicating automatic vs. manual.\n\n6. Model Fit:\n   The grey shaded area around the regression line represents the confidence interval. It widens at the extremes of the weight range, indicating less certainty in predictions for very light or very heavy vehicles.\n\n7. Outliers:\n   There are a few potential outliers, particularly at the lower and higher ends of the weight spectrum, that deviate from the general trend.\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis strongly suggests that weight is a significant factor in determining a car's fuel efficiency, with heavier cars generally having lower mpg. However, the presence of scatter in the data indicates that other factors (possibly related to engine characteristics, transmission type, or aerodynamics) also play a role in determining fuel efficiency.",.role="assistant")
```

### Getting the last reply (as raw text or structured data)

You can retrieve the last assistant reply from a message history with `last_reply()`. Typically, it returns a character vector with the text of the assistant's reply. However, if API functions have requested replies in [JSON](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation) mode, it can directly validate and return them as structured output. The function handles these different response types automatically.

If a JSON reply is detected, it returns a list with the following fields:

  - `parsed_content`: The parsed JSON content (or `NULL` in case of parsing errors).
  - `raw_response`: The direct string format of the reply.
  - `is_parsed`: A flag set to `TRUE` if JSON parsing was successful, or `FALSE` otherwise.

You can also force standard raw text replies, even when JSON mode is detected, using the `.raw` argument.

#### Example 1: Getting standard text replies

```{r standard_last_reply,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
reply_text <- llm_message("Imagine a German adress.") |>
     groq() |>
     last_reply()
```
```{r standard_last_reply_out,  eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
llm_message("Imagine a German adress.") |>
  llm_message("Let's imagine a German address. \n\nHerr Müller\nMusterstraße 12\n53111 Bonn\n\nThis address is formatted according to German conventions:\n\n- 'Herr Müller' is the recipient's name (Mr. Müller).\n- 'Musterstraße 12' is the street name and number.\n- '53111 Bonn' is the postal code and city (Bonn).",
              .role="assistant")
```

#### Example 2: Getting structured replies from APIs in JSON mode

```{r jsonmode,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
address <- llm_message('Imagine a German adress in JSON format. Reply only with JSON.') 

address|>
  ollama(.json = TRUE) |>  # API is asked to return JSON
  last_reply()

str(address)
```
```{r jsonmode_out,  eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
  address <- llm_message('Imagine a German adress in JSON format. Reply only with JSON.') 
  address$add_message("assistant",'{
   "street": "Kurfürstenstraße",
   "houseNumber": 23,
   "postcode": "10785",
   "city": "Berlin",
   "region": "Berlin",
   "country": "Deutschland"
}',json=TRUE)
last_reply(address) |> str()
```
All API functions have a `.json`-argument that enables JSON-mode. Note that `claude()` does not have an explicit JSON-mode in the API-request but you need to specify that you want only JSON-output and ideally your shema in the prompt to the assistant.

#### Example 3: Getting structured replies based on a reply schema

Currently, `openai()` is the only API function in **tidyllm** that supports enforcing a pre-specified schema for replies. By specifying a schema in the `.json_schema` argument, you ensure structured responses in a defined format:

```{r schema,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
address_schema <- tidyllm_schema(
  name = "AddressSchema",
  street = "character",
  houseNumber = "numeric",
  postcode = "character",
  city = "character",
  region = "character",
  country = "factor(Germany,France)"
)
address <- llm_message("Imagine an address in JSON format that matches the schema.") |>
        openai(.json_schema = address_schema)
```

The `tidyllm_schema()` function is a helper for defining JSON schemas. It disallows nested structures and ensures flat, predictable JSON outputs. It works with the following syntax:

- **`name`**: A name identifier for the schema.
- **`...` (fields)**: Named arguments representing field names and their data types.
  - `"character"` or `"string"`: Text fields.
  - `"factor(...)"`: Enumerations with allowable values, like `factor(Germany, France)`.
  - `"logical"`: `TRUE` or `FALSE`
  - `"numeric"`: Numbers.
  - `"type[]"`: Lists of a given type, such as `"character[]"`.


### API parameters

Different API functions support different model parameters like  how deterministic the response should be via parameters like temperature. Please read API-documentation and the documentation of the model functions for specific examples.

```{r temperature,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  temp_example <- llm_message("Explain how temperature parameters work in large language models  and why temperature 0 gives you deterministic outputs in one sentence.")
  
  #per default it is non-zero
  temp_example |> ollama(.temperature=0)
```
```{r temperature_out,  eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
  temp_example <- llm_message("Explain how temperature parameters work in large language models  and why temperature 0 gives you deterministic outputs in one sentence.")

  temp_example |>
    llm_message("In large language models, temperature parameters control the randomness of generated text by scaling the output probabilities, with higher temperatures introducing more uncertainty and lower temperatures favoring more likely outcomes; specifically, setting temperature to 0 effectively eliminates all randomness, resulting in deterministic outputs because it sets the probability of each token to its maximum likelihood value.",
                .role="assistant")
```

```{r temp2,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  #Retrying with .temperature=0
  temp_example |> ollama(.temperature=0)
```
```{r temp2_out,  eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
  temp_example |>
    llm_message("In large language models, temperature parameters control the randomness of generated text by scaling the output probabilities, with higher temperatures introducing more uncertainty and lower temperatures favoring more likely outcomes; specifically, setting temperature to 0 effectively eliminates all randomness, resulting in deterministic outputs because it sets the probability of each token to its maximum likelihood value.",
                .role="assistant")
```

### Embeddings

Embedding models in **tidyllm** transform textual inputs into vector representations, capturing semantic information that can enhance similarity comparisons, clustering, and retrieval tasks. You can generate embeddings using functions like `openai_embedding()`, `mistral_embedding()`, and `ollama_embedding()` which each interface with their respective APIs. These functions create vector representations for texts.  These functions return vector representations either for each message in a message history or, more typically for this application, for each entry in a character vector. 

### Streaming back responses (Experimental)

All chat API-functions support real-time streaming of reply tokens to the console while the model works with the `.stream=TRUE` argument.  While this feature offers slightly better feedback on model behavior in real-time, it’s not particularly useful for data-analysis workflows. We consider this feature experimental and recommend using non-streaming responses for production tasks. Note that error handling in streaming callbacks varies by API and differs in quality at this time.

### Choosing the Right Model and API

tidyllm supports multiple APIs, each offering distinct large language models with varying strengths. The choice of which model or API to use often depends on the specific task, cost considerations, and data privacy concerns.

1. **`claude()` (Anthropic API):** [Claude](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/welcome) is known for generating thoughtful, nuanced responses, making it ideal for tasks that require more human-like reasoning, such as summarization or creative writing. Claude Sonnet 3.5 currently is one of the top-performing models on many benchmarks. However, it can sometimes be more verbose than necessary, and it lacks direct JSON support, which requires additional prompting and validation to ensure structured output. 

2. **`openai()` (OpenAI API):** Models on the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat), particularly the GPT-4o model, are extremely versatile and perform well across a wide range of tasks, including text generation, code completion, and multimodal analysis. In addition the o1-reasoning models offer very good performance for a set of specific task (at a relatively high price). There is also an `azure_openai()` function if you prefer to use the OpenAI API on Microsoft Azure. 

3. **`mistral()` (EU-based):** [Mistral](https://docs.mistral.ai/) offers  lighter-weight, open-source models developed and hosted in the EU, making it particularly appealing if data protection (e.g., GDPR compliance) is a concern. While the models may not be as powerful as GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet, Mistral offers good performance for standard text generation tasks.

4. **`groq()` (Fast):** [Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/quickstart) offers a unique advantage with its custom AI accelerator hardware, that get you the fastest output available on any API. It delivers high performance at low costs, especially for tasks that require fast execution. It hosts many strong open-source models, like **lamma3:70b**.

5. **`ollama()` (Local Models):** If data privacy is a priority, running open-source models like **gemma2::9B** locally via [ollama](https://ollama.com/) gives you full control over model execution and data. However, the trade-off is that local models require significant computational resources, and are often not quite as powerful as the large API-providers. The [ollama blog](https://ollama.com/blog) regularly has posts about new models and their advantages that you can download via `ollama_download_model()`.
